## Challenges to causal interpretations

. . .

### 1. Reverse causation


::: incremental

- Instead of $Z$ causing $Y$, $Y$ causes $Z$

- **Simultaneity:** $Z$ causes $Y$ and vice versa

- Individuals *sort* into condition $Z$ in a manner that predicts outcome $Y$

- Treatment and control are not comparable

::: incremental

- Random assignment avoids this *in expectation*

- Hard to overcome with *observational causal* data strategies

- Need to pretend that we can analyze data as if it was an experiment
:::

## Quasi-experiments

::: incremental
- Answer strategies that produce data as-if they were drawn from an experiment

- **Natural experiment:** Random assignment outside of the researcher control

- **Example:** Choosing municipalities at random for auditing

- **Quasi-experiment:** Conditions are assigned in a manner that is **sufficiently orthogonal** to potential outcomes

# Regression Discontinuity {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

## Hoekstra (2019)

. . .


![](figs/hoekstra_2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Treatment take-up

![](figs/hoekstra_1.png){fig-align="center"}


## Regression discontinuity designs

- Three ingredients:

. . .

1. Score `(running variable)`

2. Cutoff `(threshold)`

3. Treatment `(at least two conditions)`

## Visual representation

![](figs/rdd_viz.png){fig-align="center"}



## How do you get an estimate?

. . .

- Two approaches to RDD data:

. . .

1. Local randomization

2. Continuity-based

## Local randomization

::: incremental
- Potential outcomes are not random because they depend on the score `(and other things)`

- However, around the cutoff, treatment assignment is as good as random

- **Example:** Barely winning an election

- So we can pretend we have an experiment within a **bandwidth** around the cutoff

:::

## Bandwidth tradeoff

![](figs/rdd_bw.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

::: aside
A small bandwidth has low bias but high variance. A larger bandwidth has lower variance but more bias.
:::


## Continuity-based approach

::: incremental
- Treatment assignment is **deterministic at** the cutoff

- **Example:** Financial aid if income below a threshold

- But usually too few or no units at the cutoff

- **Task:** Approximate the *gap* at the cutoff as best as possible

- This becomes a **line drawing** problem
:::

## Line drawing: Parametric

![](figs/rdd_poly.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

::: aside
Different functional forms change the size of the gap
:::

## Line drawing: Nonparametric

![](figs/rdd_loess.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

::: aside
These lines are made by an algorithm that calculates the local average at many windows or bins of data
:::

## Line drawing: Bandwidth

![](figs/rdd_bw2.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

::: aside
The size of the bandwidth determines the data you use to draw lines

# Difference-in-differences {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

## Leininger et al (2023)

. . .

![](figs/leininger_1.png)

. . .

- **Temporary disenfranchisement** may push voters away from democracy

. . .

- **Outcomes:** Survey questions about internal/external efficacy, satisfaction with democracy, political interest

## Comparisons

![](figs/leininger_2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Results

![](figs/leininger_3.png)

::: aside
ATEs estimated via difference-in-differences
:::

## Difference-in-differences design

::: incremental
- *At least* two groups or conditions `(treatment,control)`

- *At least* two time periods `(pre- and post-treatment)`

- Once treated, units **stay on**

- We accept that selection bias is unavoidable

- But comparing before-after changes between groups allows us to calculate treatment effect

  kbl(align = "lcc") %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Timing" = 2))
