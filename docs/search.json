We will examine how to conduct surveys to understand variation in public opinion or attitudes toward several subjects across the world. We will also examine empirical strategies to generate credible evidence to inform policy and decision-making in different contexts.\nThe main learning objective of this course is to develop standards to think about the appropriate research design before conducting a study. This is useful to those working with quantitative data either directly or indirectly. We will work towards that goal through a combination of reading, discussion, and hands-on practice.\nStudents will have the opportunity to practice working with statistical software to evaluate and compare the statistical properties of alternative research designs. Students will also get the chance to practice discussing and communicating research design choices to a general or expert audience through speech and writing.\nThis course contributes to the Research Methods and/or Analysis requirement for the Concurrent Certificate in Applied Social Sciences Research. As such, it relies heavily on statistics as the main tool to think about research design. Students are expected to have taken at least POLSCI 3NN3 – Statistical Analysis of Primary Data or have equivalent experience with statistics and statistical programming software. I expect us to understand the main findings of a quantitative social science study and work backwards from there to discuss the research design choices that researchers made. I also expect, but not assume, some experience with loading, cleaning, and analyzing data."

Research Design in the Social Sciences: Declaration, Diagnosis, Redesign. Princeton University Press\n\nYou can read the digital copy of the book for free by using the link above or purchase the physical version if you choose. Purchasing the book is not necessary to succeed in this course. The rest of the syllabus refers to this book with the initials RD.\nThe companion textbook is:\n\nGrolemund, Garret, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Hadley Wickham. 2023. R for Data Science. O’Reilly Media Inc\n\nOnce again, you can read the digital copy of this book for free with the link above. You are not required to read this book for this course but consulting it on occasion may help you overcome hurdles while working with statistical software. Since the digital version is constantly updated, I do not recommend buying a physical copy.\nWe will also read academic papers that discuss or apply the research designs we will cover. Most of these are available through the library’s subscription. See this link for instructions to access library resources while off campus. If not available through the library or elsewhere online, I will upload them to the course website.\n\n\nSoftware\nWe will use R and RStudio to program research designs and evaluate their properties. The advantage of R is that it is free and open source, meaning that you will be able to apply everything you learn in this course anywhere else. The disadvantage is that it has a somewhat steep learning curve. I believe the investment is worthwhile for anyone working with data or in data-adjacent careers.\nThe computers in our classroom should have a recent installation of both programs. While I expect us to spend some class meeting time working with R, you will most likely need access to the software outside of the classroom. You are welcome to bring a laptop to class.\nYou can install R and RStudio in your personal computer. You can use this link for installation instructions on Windows and MacOS (ignore the parts about package building). See this link for installation instructions on Chromebooks, which is a bit more involved.\nYou can also use Posit Cloud to access RStudio from any web browser. A free account should be sufficient for the purposes of this course and has the advantage of letting you access your work across devices.\nYou should reach out to the instructor if you foresee any challenges with accessing computing resources outside of the classroom."

You should upload assignments via Avenue.\nAssignments should use the author-date citation style of the Chicago Manual of Style. You do not need to include citations for the weekly lab assignments, but you can do so if you wish.\nYou can use the templates available in the Resources tab to format your assignments, slight modifications within RStudio are acceptable. If you write assignments outside of RStudio, they should be double-spaced, 12 pt font, with 1-inch margins. Assignments do not require a cover sheet. Figures, tables, and bibliography are not part of word counts. You can use this tool to count words in PDF documents.\n\n\nLate assignments\nIn this course, assignments are designed to be cumulative; each assignment builds on the last. For this reason, it is important to not fall behind and to complete assignments on time. Assignments are considered delayed if they are submitted after one hour but within 24 hours of the due date. Assignments will be considered late if they are submitted after 24 hours but before 7 days of the due date. Assignments not submitted within 7 days of the due date will be considered as not delivered.\nUse of the MSAF form will automatically move the due date 72 hours, with no other possibility of extension or late submission without additional confirmation of the circumstances by the Faculty advising office. If you use the MSAF form for an assignment, you do not need to email me. Just turn in the assignment within 72 hours via Avenue or to the Political Science office (KTH 527). There is a drop box for after hours.\n\n\nOther policies\nSee the PDF version of the syllabus for McMaster University policies that may apply to this course."

I expect our class discussions to start from the main findings of a study and then work backwards to understand how a study was conducted and why it was done so in a certain why.\nThis means that you may have to pay extra attention to things that you tend to ignore when reading for other courses. My advice is to try to read strategically. I find this guide by Amelia Hoover Green useful.\nI find myself at odds about assigning readings with a lot of math. On the one hand, I find equations useful to talk about general design ideas that we can then translate to specific research contexts. On the other hand, I got into political science because I wanted to avoid math as much as possible (it didn’t work), which means I have to fight my natural inclination of skipping all the formulas formulae formulæ.\nOver time, I have learned that the problem is not so much the math, but the language attached to it. Academic articles often expect the audience to be an insider that already knows how to read the math, so they skip the plain language explanation. I find it useful to try to rewrite equations in words as I take notes, but that takes time that you may not have.\nI plan to use some of our class time clarifying important quantities of with words and coding examples."

Instead, you will receive a grade at the end of the term based on how many satisfactory assignments you submitted, how many extra assignments you submitted, and how often you missed class or submitted work late.\nBy enrolling in this course, you accept the general terms of the grading agreement.

At a minimum, I expect you to come to lecture ready to discuss the material and collaborate with your peers on weekly assignments. To meet the grading contract, you should miss no more than three classes and have a “satisfactory” participation mark toward the end of the semester.\nTo obtain a satisfactory participation mark, you must make interventions conducive to a productive and respectful learning environment for yourself and others during class, office hours, online communications, or through other means that best suit your learning style.\nWe all have different interests and personalities, so I will keep an open mind about what constitutes satisfactory participation, and I encourage you to be proactive about pursuing the participation avenues that are most productive for you. I will grade your participation status as satisfactory (S) or unsatisfactory (U) once during mid-term recess and once after the last week of instruction. You can schedule a meeting with me at any point of the semester to discuss how to secure a satisfactory participation mark.\n\n\nWeekly lab assignments, due on Mondays at 5 PM\nWe will have weekly assignments aimed at practicing the application of course material with statistical software. These range from coding exercises to evaluating and improving research designs. You are encouraged to work on these assignments in groups during the lab sessions and beyond, but you must submit individual reports.\nWe will start working on the weekly assignments during our lab session. On most weeks, you will need additional time to finish them. There will be 11 weekly lab assignments in total, but only 9 marked as satisfactory are required to meet the baseline grading contract.\n\n\nResponse papers, due on Wednesdays at 8:30 AM\nYou can choose to write a response paper in the weeks that involve reading original research studies. A response paper is a short form document that summarizes the question, relevance, and research design of a study and then uses the course material to critically evaluate an aspect of its design or implementation. The main task is to identify questions and issues that require our attention during the discussion portion of our weekly meeting. You are expected to engage actively during class discussion in the weeks you write a response paper. In weeks with multiple assigned papers, you can choose whichever you prefer to discuss. The course website contains a template with guidelines on how to write a response paper for this course. Response papers are due 24 hours before our class meeting.\nResponse papers should be between 700 and 1,000 words. You are required to complete at least 3 response papers with a satisfactory mark to meet the baseline grading contract.\n\n\nOptional final project: Pre-analysis plan, due on April 25 by 11:59 PM\nYour optional final project is a pre-analysis plan. This is a document that outlines the steps of a future study addressing a novel question of academic interest or policy/industry relevance. This document identifies a problem or question that needs to be addressed, explains its relevance or novelty, proposes a research design, and evaluates its properties to guide implementation. The Resources will host resources to write a pre-analysis plan. Pre-analysis plans should range from 3,000 to 4,000 words.\nYou can reach out to me via email to indicate your interest in completing this optional final assignment by April 4 at 11:59PM. I will circulate instructions for the pre-analysis plan to those who sign up on April 8 before 5PM."

    "section": "Contract grading",
    "text": "Contract grading\n\nWhy contract grading?\nThe main motivation to deviate from conventional grading is to emphasize the amount of work and learning you put in the course over getting correct answers. My primary objective in this course is to make you think hard and carefully about research design, so I do not want to tie your grade to a specific set of answers or a grading rubric.\nI also believe that contract grading leads to a more caring learning environment in two ways. First, emphasizing work and learning over correctness gives you an opportunity to bring yourself, your interests, and career goals to the classroom and course materials. Second, it breaks the traditional power structure between instructor and students by allowing you to be the owner of your final grade. You can put as little or as much work in this course as the grade you aim to obtain and there is nothing I can do about it other than determining if the amount of work you put in an assignment is satisfactory or not.\nThe name “contract grading” reflects that the syllabus is essentially an agreement between me, the instructor, and you, the student, about how much work you should complete to get the grade you want. As any contract, the terms are negotiable and we will have an opportunity to make adjustments as both parties see fit in the first day of class.\n\n\nWhat counts as satisfactory/unsatisfactory for assignments?1\nIn general, submitting a satisfactory assignment means that you follow the assignment instructions and complete the list of questions or tasks. If your assignment is marked as unsatisfactory, I will share detailed feedback of what parts of it need improvement. If you wish to resubmit and assignment marked as unsatisfactory, you must receive instructor approval before doing so. To keep your workload manageable, I will not allow you to redo an assignment marked as unsatisfactory unless doing so is necessary to get the grade you want. The goal here is not to punish you, but to give you an opportunity to learn from your mistakes without fear of failure/lost grades and to avoid an excessive workload. My advice is to do your best to stay on top of assignments but not stress too much if you miss a few.\nThere is one other situation where you might submit a completed assignment and have your work deemed “unsatisfactory.” These are instances in which the work is completed, but the content is intentionally or obviously harmful. For example, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise. If the person reading your work finds it to be harmful, you will be contacted to discuss the issue. However, submissions that are repeatedly engaging in harmful behavior will be deemed unsatisfactory and recorded as missing.\n\n\nWhere can I learn more about contract grading?\nHere are some useful links:\n\nMelzer, Dan, D.J. Quinn, Lisa Sperber, & Sarah Faye. “So Your Instructor is Using Contract Grading…” https://writingcommons.org/article/so-your-instructor-is-using-contract-grading/\nSteve Sears. “Reducing stress and increasing engagement with ‘contract grading’.” An interview with Marika Brown about her motivation to introduce contract grading. https://mi.mcmaster.ca/reducing-stress-and-increasing-engagement-with-contract-grading/\nInoue, Asao B. 2019.
