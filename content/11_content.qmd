## Overview

We use experiments to understand whether a policy would work. We usually care about whether said policy works **outside** of the experimental setting. Experiments alone do not answer that question. Which opens a conversation on the scope and limitations of using experiments to inform policy-making.

The lab illustrates these ideas by giving you the chance to write your own design based on an application of your choosing.
